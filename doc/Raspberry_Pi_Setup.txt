# Here are the steps I had to perform to get nSpace built.
# All of these steps may or may not be needed but it doesn't hurt to run them anyway

# Update the actual package information (this is needed to update the locations for where to get 'install' packages)
sudo apt-get update

# Update the apt-get installed components (this might take a while, optional ?)
sudo apt-get upgrade

# Install cmake in order to build the makefiles for nSpace/other packages
sudo apt-get install cmake

# Install OpenSSL (optional, needed for web-socket server)
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev

# UUID generation
sudo apt-get install uuid-dev

# Install nSpace source
git clone https://github.com/nSpaceLabs/nSpace.git
